* move to Gmaps API3, as API2 is being shutdown in May 2013

* have a more slick UI in portrait mode for large screen devices

* add a way to zoom the map quickly in and out.
  Pinching seems quite anoying

* implement option to follow the selected vehicle or user location,
  as position changes

* in the field tracking view, distance to target vehicle

known bugs
------------------------

* on iphone, where the screen has higher DPI, all icons
  look blurry because they are blown up. Should have 
  a mechanism to detect such display and a set of higher
  resolution icons

  all icons are now vectors, map markers are still low res images

  GMaps API3 should resolve this issue on retina displays

* app might crash if map has too many elements. Also, could manifest
  when viewed on desktops/laptops making the interface slugish.
  This is best resolved on the server. Some sort of simplification 
  of paths, and only very recent position data etc.
