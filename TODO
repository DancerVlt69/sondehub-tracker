* adjust colors and fonts of the template to be more slick

* new menu
  - home is just the regular screen
  - current location: only on devices supporting geolocation
  - chase car view, where you can switch uploading of GPS data
    to habitat, so a chase car is displayed on the map
  - help cotains credits and useful info

* chase car option

* move to Gmaps API3, as API2 is being shutdown in May 2013

* have a more slick UI in portrait mode for large screen devices

* add a way to zoom the map quickly in and out.
  Pinching seems quite anoying

* implement option to follow the selected vehicle or user location,
  as position changes

* in the field tracking view, distance to target vehicle

known bugs
------------------------

* if geolocation is available, but no coordinates have
  the locate me button on the menu, display a popup

* on iphone, where the screen has higher DPI, all icons
  look blurry because they are blown up. Should have 
  a mechanism to detect such display and a set of higher
  resolution icons
