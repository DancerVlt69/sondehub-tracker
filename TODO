* minimize footprint

* combine+minify CSSs into a single file

* combine+minify JS into a single file

known bugs
------------------------

* on iphone, where the screen has higher DPI, all icons
  look blurry because they are blown up. Should have 
  a mechanism to detect such display and a set of higher
  resolution icons
