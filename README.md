## Currently Supported Devices

### iOS, Anroid, Deskstops

* Modern browser required (IE not supported)
* Browsers supporting _Geolocation API_ will have `Chase car mode` available
* For best expirence on _iOS devices_, add the webapp to your home screen.
This will hide Safari's UI and make it look like a native app. I think it also allows it to run in the background.


## iPhone demo page

Portrait and landscape test. Just open `test-iphone3g.html` in your browser of choice
